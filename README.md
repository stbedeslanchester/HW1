# HW1 Programming  Practice on Data Types and variables.
All these programs MUST be well commented

1. Write a program which stores 4 values in variables adds them up and prints out the result.
2. Amend the above program to print out ” __ + __ +___ +____ is ____”.  This must include the actual variables, concatenated to strings.
3. Write a program which stores Your first and last name as a variable,  then prints them out together.
4. Write a program that contains one print() statement only, but prints your address accurately on separate lines.
5. Write a program that stores three dates invariables “format must be dd/mm/yyyy”  The year is then output by the program.
6. My database is corrupted. All the email addresses have “#” instead of “@”.  Can you write a program that would replace this?

Extension:
We’ve seen how the computer takes input with the line: input()
This instruction actually returns a string, so we could assign it to a variable.
7. Write a program that asks the user for their name, and age.  Both answers should be assigned to variables.  The program will output “Hello [name],  [age] isn’t too old!!”.
